###what made this project to stand up

the django website that is to serve the basis for aham to acknowledge your thoughts 
the example i had to this is from the docker official website ::

https://docs.docker.com/compose/django/

this shows how to use the docker engine to make the most out of a django project

in this tutorial the docker engine is to be composed of 

the minimal python 3 and pip

pip install is to work and  add django and django rest framework for serving capacity of the project 


to work the system might use keras or theano or the tensorflow projects to let the innovation rolling on the shores in the space 

the procedure taken till now for launching the base project 

1 install  docker and docker-compose 
2 install anaconda or virtualenv 
3 create a conda or virtualenv environment
3.5 start the environment and check which python and pip 
4 install the reqiured dependencies for the project {{ for example existing dependency is 
    django and django rest framework
}}
5 create a requirements file from the installed dependencies 
6 create the docker file as per the page recomendations
7 create a docker compose file with the statements of the site and the required changes if any 
8 make the docker image and change the owner ship of the django admin project creator 


8.5 the django admin project that had been generated from the docker engine initially came with default root access to change it to user level permissions we reqiure to change permissions to $USER

the command is not useful =>> sudo chmod 777 [filenames] 

lastly the command mentioned in the doc of the website is to the resque
command :: sudo chown -R $USER:$USER [filenames]


9  ===>>> start the django server from the docker compose file {{ not completed yet }}
10 this is the point where we start coding for the project 
11 create a django webapp inside the django admin rendered python webserver project 

12 this as per the django system should automatically boot up from the server 


now the existing problem 
the ai codec and the buiseness logic is to go half into the open source project files and half into aprivate git rrepo hosted at bitbucket


this project has to have continuous integration and better delivery options for the management of the lifecycles of the system

third the updation of the main branch of the github repositories will triger a automatic docker image build and inform developers about the process log {{ either pass or fail}}

the docker image should get a single point of deployment to let incoming developers to this project get excited by the possibillites baked within =>> we want this human resource 

there has to be a web relay chat service and a development helpdesk provided of the project 
consumer and developer forum 

the basic system is to be nodge recent system to level what others can provide but with the only difference of 
### what is the reachability of the system

india is full of this human resource -- most of the mnc feeds upon this process 

### what will be the future of this buiseness plan

{{ 
    [
        to be made by the earliest possible dates
        initially it will be made on microsoft documents 
        and kept in the company safe for the future references
    ],
}} 

###strong bound requirements assets and estimated liabilities of the future

###weak possiblities that are deadlines for the version management of the project
